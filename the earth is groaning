The earth is groaning, sound the alarm
Our rivers are calling us to come
To protect the earth once more from great harm

Just as in the beginning 
When God walked with dust creatures in the cool of the day
The sun a light
The leaping river greens most bright

Sound the alarm
Call every daughter and every son to return to their guard
While there is still time
Before the rivers roar in an overflowing surge
And dusty streets where frail homes live
Are washed away with cries

Sound the alarm
While there is still time
